Hi! I'm an indie game developer from Long Island, NY.

I'm primarily a C programmer but I also program in Rust and C# regularly.
I have experience using Unity Engine, Godot and Unreal Engine but right
now I'm working on my own [game engine](https://github.com/smushy64/museum.git).

I mostly develop on Windows (game development amiright?) with Neovim as my primary editor.

You can reach me at (smushyaa@gmail.com)[email:smushyaa@gmail.com] or
my [discord](discord:smushy666).
